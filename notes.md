# Neural Network Design

- Generated initial state
- Data trained on will be generated randomly and decide the number of inputs
- Layer count and size of layers will be inferred from the randomly generated starting setup
- There will be only one output variable
- Network will be stored using f64 variables
- Training rate will be a static `0.1`
- The first entry of each observation in the dataset is the expected output
