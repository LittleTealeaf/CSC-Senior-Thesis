	abstract = {Developers of deep learning applications (shortened as application
	            developers) commonly use deep learning frameworks in their
	            projects. However, due to time pressure, market competition, and
	            cost reduction, developers of deep learning frameworks (shortened
	            as framework developers) often have to sacrifice software quality
	            to satisfy a shorter completion time. This practice leads to
	            technical debt in deep learning frameworks, which results in the
	            increasing burden to both the application developers and the
	            framework developers in future development.In this paper, we
	            analyze the comments indicating technical debt (self-admitted
	            technical debt) in 7 of the most popular open-source deep learning
	            frameworks. Although framework developers are aware of such
	            technical debt, typically the application developers are not. We
	            find that: 1) there is a significant number of technical debt in
	            all the studied deep learning frameworks. 2) there is design debt,
	            defect debt, documentation debt, test debt, requirement debt,
	            compatibility debt, and algorithm debt in deep learning frameworks.
	            3) the majority of the technical debt in deep learning framework is
	            design debt (24.07\% - 65.27\%), followed by requirement debt (7.09
	            \% - 31.48\%) and algorithm debt (5.62\% - 20.67\%). In some
	            projects, compatibility debt accounts for more than 10\%. These
	            findings illustrate that technicael debt is common in deep learning
	            frameworks, and many types of technical debt also impact the deep
	            learning applications. Based on our findings, we highlight future
	            research directions and provide recommendations for practitioners.},

	            found within popular open-sourced deep learning / machine learning
	            frameworks. They find and categorize the technical debt based on
	            comments left by the developers. The frameworks that they looked at
	            are mostly python based, however there are some frameworks listed
	            for Java and C\texttt{++}. There are some interesting conclusions
	            by looking at what types of debt that frameworks find themselves in
	            based on the language they are written in. },
